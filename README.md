# World Generator (a.k.a. Mostly Civilized)
## What is it now...?
This is a world map generator developed with Unity Game Engine in C# by Richard Legrand. It is inspired by Quill18's "Mostly Civilized: A Hex-Based 4x Game Engine for Unity" video series on which it builds upon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-rCuN7uMR8
## What will it be...?
The goal of this project is to create a realistic-ish sandbox for simulation of human civilization. Unlike god-games like the Civilization series, where the player is the driving force of the events, here the player will be more of a passive observant, only able to plant some seeds and give a few guidance to see where it will drive humanity.
