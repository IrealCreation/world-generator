# World Generato (a.k.a. Mostly Civilized)
## What is now...?
This is world map generator developed with Unity Game Engine in C#, inspired by Quill18's "Mostly Civilized" video series on which it builds upon.
## What will it be...?
The goal of this project is to create a realistic-ish sandbox for simulation of human civilization. Unlike god-games like the Civilization series, where the player is the driving force of the events, here the player will be more of a passive observant, only able to plant some seeds and give a few guidance to see where it will drive humanity.
