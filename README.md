# World Generator
## What is it now...?
This is a world map generator developed with Unity Game Engine in C#. It is inspired by Quill18's "Mostly Civilized" video series on which it builds upon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-rCuN7uMR8
## What will it be...?
The goal of this project is to create a realistic-ish sandbox for simulation of human civilization. Unlike god-games like the Civilization series, where the player is the driving force of the events, here the player will be more of a passive observant, only able to plant some seeds and give a few guidance to see where it will drive humanity.
## Where are we so far...?
So far, the following features are functionnal:
- Creation of a world map with landmasses and oceans, based on volcanic activity, accounting for elevation, temperature and humidity in a hexagonal grid system.
- Spawning of rivers.
- Attribution of biomes on each hexagon tile, depending on its elevation, temperature and humidity.
- Semi-random spawning of some natural features and resources (forests, reefs, salars...).
- Possibility to manually spawn human settlements on the map.
- Extension of human settlements' territories across the grid following a preference system.
- (WIP) The human settlements research technologies, create buildings and make artworks depending of their preferences.
